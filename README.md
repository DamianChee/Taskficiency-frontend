# Taskficiency (SEI-49 Capstone Project)

SEI-49 project 3 (PERN)

This app was created using PERN stack while using Sequelize for the ORM as both a learning experience as well as a request from a 'client'.

After some discussion, the app hopes to solve/alleviate several administrative duties to aid in handling their business and streamline it. Providing assistance through technology to track employee attendance, create reports as a format, allow employees to modify and create new reports based off a saved format for archiving and work progress tracking for the employer, etc.
